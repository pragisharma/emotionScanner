  hihi welcome to emotion scanner again!! <br>
  this was made with mostly jupyter notebook and a little bit of flask with python and html <br>
  <br> 
  It's an emotional scanner in order to promote mental health, since it's currently neglected in high school lol. <br>
  The inspiration behind it was due to the app be real that recently "trended." I wanted to experiment a project <br>
  with CV and mental health.  So, I researched and thought of a way to keep track of your mental health with the facial <br> 
  expressions. In the past I've done CV projects with scanning ASL signs, so it was a similar experience. Also, I had a <br>
  couple issues with teams which resulted in me getting the idea a week ago, and the development yesterday so it is quite scuffed.  <br>
